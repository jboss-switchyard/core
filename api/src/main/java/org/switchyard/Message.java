/**
 * A {@code Message} represents an individual input or output of a service, the
 * content of which is interpreted by service implementation logic.  A Message
 * does not carry context specific to a service invocation, which means that it
 * can be copied and reused across service invocations.
 * <p>
 * There are two distinct parts to a message:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>Content</b> : the main body, or payload, of the message. There is
 * only one body per message instance.  The message body is mutable, so message
 * processing logic can access the content, change it (transform, enrich, etc.),
 * and then set it back on the message.
 * <p>
 * <li> <b>Attachments</b> : provide the ability to associate content with a
 * message separate from  the main body, allowing it to be parsed independently.
 * One example  would be a binary image that is referenced by the main body of
 * the message.  The attachment may be too large to be processed in certain
 * services or the service implementation may not be able to  parse/interpret
 * it.
 * </ul>
